# project1
this project, we start from Nand, and base on it , we will make some elementary gates, such as And, Or, and so on.

I have learn Digital Circuit, when I was a Sophomore. So I think this is easy, although sometimes I can't complete assignments by myself. But my teacher never told me the connection between the logical gates and computer. 

I think there are two many logical gates, and it's difficult to remember, but I get the thought of this project.
