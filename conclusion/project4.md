# project4
this project, we learn the assembly language. I don't know why we will learn software in nand2TetrisI. Maybe we need learn machine language in nand2TetrisI, but it's difficult to learn， read and write， so we just using assembly replacing it.

Three concepts:
A Register: address/data
D Register: data
M Register： RAM[A]

The language of this course is meaningless in reality, but this project is import for project5 and 6, especially, project6. Because project6 need program a lot, so you should use this project and courses.

And we should attach importance to A-instruction and C-instruction.Especially C-instruction, such as computation field, jump field, destination field. And C-instruction is powerful.
